	info:"Delorean are a Spanish alternative dance band formed in 2000 in Zarautz, a Basque town. Vocalist and bassist Ekhi Lopetegi, guitarist Tomas Palomo, keyboardist Unai Lazcano, and drummer Igor Escudeo wanted to explore their mutual interests, from the local punk rock scene to electronic music. The quartet, who named the band after the iconic time machine featured in the Back to the Future series, released an EP and two studio albums between 2004 and 2006 to little mainstream success. In 2007, Palomo left the band and was replaced by Guillermo Astrain. Delorean subsequently relocated to Barcelona, veering towards more computer-based composition and production. Tiring of the relative low quality of the local dance music scene, the band members created their own eclectic club night, Desparrame, in which they continued the evolution of their music. Remixes for the likes of The xx, Cold Cave, and Franz Ferdinand gave Delorean exposure in the music press.<br/><br/> From <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delorean_(band)' target='_blank'>Wikipedia</a>",

Kompakt itself was formally founded in 1998, combining several existing labels, the record store and distributor and also event organizing activities.<br/><br/>According to Grooves magazine, 'Kompakt's chief aesthetic objective has always been the perfect marriage of ambient texture and linear 4x4 structure—blending deep, granular sound design with the 4-bar rhythmic intensity and patterning that makes house and techno so club-effective'.Kompakt has been noted for releases enriching abstract techno tracks with pop elements such as vocals - Mayer has stated that 'We grew up with pop music and really like traces of pop in techno music. This is probably Kompakt's biggest strength-- that we can detect these pop traces and give them a home'. British music critic Simon Reynolds has characterized Kompakt as the 'label that's contributed more than any other to Germany's dominance of electronic dance music this decade [the 2000s]'.<br/><br/>From <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kompakt' target='_blank'>Wikipedia</a>",

	info:"Martin Stimming was born in Giessen, Germany. Playing various instruments like violin, piano and drums when he was 10 years, discovering electronic music 5 years after. DJ Krush and Grooverider provided his introduction into this new electronic sound dimension. About a year later he came upon techno. At this time he was living in Butzbach, a small town near Frankfurt – influenced very much from Chris Liebing and Sven Vaeth, starting to djing and buying vinyl. He soon realized that for him making music was more fullfilling than 'just' playing a groove, or mixing a record, so he started to take his production seriously and moved to Hamburg to attend SAE (School of Audio Engineering). Music had become the most important thing in his life. For 2 years, he was the producer part of the Gebrueder Ton, and in this time he befriended Diynamic (a record label from Solomun and Adriano). Stimming's debut on Diynamic was Diynamic 006 Feuervogel EP, which he produces together with Solomun. The man just never seems to sleep. Releasing and remixing all over, right now he is definitely in demand, and its obvious to all why. Everything he touches turns to gold and once again with have a couple of nuggets here for you today. There is plenty more to come, from this talented young producer.<br/><br/> From <a href='http://www.beatport.com/artist/stimming/37642' target='_blank'>Beatport</a>"	,
