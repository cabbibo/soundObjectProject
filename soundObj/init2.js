With an arsenal of records, they started crafting songs with disco boogie samples and manipulating the songs with a strong instrumental hip-hop sensibility. This crosses over to their live performances and the duo has developed a tight and interactive partnership through their controllers and softwares. 'Controlism' as the boys like to term it.
