	info:"Andrew Field-Pickering's work as Maxmillion Dunbar has ping-ponged through electronic music's vast network of subgenres, hitting zonked-out, late-night house, jumping into rough-edged lo-fi, experimental work and beyond. His latest album, House of Woo (out Feb. 19th on RVNG), is his most gorgeous and full-bodied yet. Field-Pickering's got a massive record collection, and his genuine enthusiasm for electronic music (and really, music as a whole) is unmatched. This Aurora Halal-directed video for 'Loving the Drift' captures that vibe in its all colorful glory, but it's the song that really stands out, with its endless synth washes glide over clipped hi-hats and stuttered bass. It's not minimal, but Field-Pickering never over does it; he lets the track breathe naturally, with a life of its own.<br/><br/>From <a href='http://www.thefader.com/2013/02/07/video-maxmillion-dunbar-loving-the-drift/' target='_blank'>The Fader</a>",

New artists compete with each other so brutally for press and attention these days. Jacques simply toured, performed, kept in the studio. And with Another Girl all the hype sort of came to him. He came out the gate with two strong records for us and nothing short of an anthem on the Night Slugs Allstars CD and grew like real artists should, with steady high performing releases. As the initial disbelief at how young he was, his love of heart aching RnB, what he looked like and who he used to record as sink further and further back into the pages of Google the initial hype will be succeeded by better and better music, some limited run white labels, a touring analogue live show and a stronger vision from an artist who never really cared bout being the man of the moment. Jacques Greene is here for the long run. This plan was a long time coming.<br/><br/> From <a href='http://thisisluckyme.com/music/jacques-greene/' target='_blank'>Lucky Me</a>",

With an arsenal of records, they started crafting songs with disco boogie samples and manipulating the songs with a strong instrumental hip-hop sensibility. This crosses over to their live performances and the duo has developed a tight and interactive partnership through their controllers and softwares. 'Controlism' as the boys like to term it.
